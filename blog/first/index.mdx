This is my first blog post! Isn't it *great*?

Design a data for your application isn't a tough task if you have to do it from scratch. But migration or conversion project, might have few limitations, in terms of modifying the data structure (or the response structure which is being served to the Angular application through API service).

I would like to share one of the use case, where the client didn't allow to modify the data response for particular section and we had to find a solution to render correct UI with the same.

Below response was coming from the backend service.
